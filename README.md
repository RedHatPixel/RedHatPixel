- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RedHatPixel
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning html, css, javascript

I'm new to this, so don't expect me to know everything about github or any coding skills and libraries.
If I'm not online maybe because Im currently learning more about programming languanges and IT related studies.
